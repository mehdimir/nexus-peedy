NexusPEED=========Nexus Personal Edition, a "hobby" project of mine, based on Nexus OSS Core, chopped with some not needed features, and added some new ones. Targeted for "personal" setups, usually on same workstation where developer works.Main goals:* have a "fast forward" of Nexus, added new features* simple, lightweigt, umm, featherweight deployment and runtime* speedy as Gonzales ;)WWW:https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Nexus/NexusPEEDIssue tracking:none yetThis Git repository is mirrored from Sonatype Nexus OSS SVN, and here will rebase happen. So, please be careful!## BranchesI used a great blog to create a "one way" mirror of SVN repository written here:http://www.fnokd.com/2008/08/20/mirroring-svn-repository-to-github/So, the setup is similar, we have the following branches:* vendor - this is 1:1 mirror of the TRUNK of the Nexus SVN, no changes here.* master - this is where work is, and *rebase* happens regularly (done manually, not cron-ed like Bob did!)Have fun!~t~
